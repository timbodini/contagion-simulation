    "After seeing a lot of really bad statistical analysis of how the Wuhan coronavirus could spread, I decided to build a simple agent-based model to simulate how a disease could break out in a model setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our model setting\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, the world is broken up into 10 clusters (\"countries\") of varying size, with the only constraint being that China has a relatively large population and that China is the only source of animal-to-human transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step of the simulation, there is a small chance of animal-to-human transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, there is a chance of transmission inside the cluster -- sick people infecting others when going about day-to-day life.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, there is the chance that one of those sick people travels, and infects people in another cluster. This is the only way (in our model) that the virus can make its way to countries besides China.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a patient is infected, they are contagious for some amount of time before containment, at which point they can't infect anyone else. After some amount of time in containment, they either die or recover and become immune; in either case, they can no longer become sick, nor can they infect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "(All the time durations and transmission probabilities used are laid out in the \"Constants\" section below.)"

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been a fascinating model to study. What is imminently clear is that containment of the virus within borders is legitimately the only way to avoid the entire world population getting the virus at some point or another. With sufficient containment -- and based on the current characteristics of the virus -- it likely will saturate China and eventually be contained before saturating every country in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern, depending on the parameters you use, is that a certain percentage of the population is infected before containment measures start to decrease the total number of contagious people until it gets back to zero. The key question is, how many people across the world need to get sick before the curve turns around. In some parameterizations, the entire population is affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you change some of these parameters -- transmission likelihood, travel probability, or even time before seeing a doctor -- the outcome can be very different. The curve can become a simple exponential growth until the whole population of earth has been affected. It can reach some maximum and then start dying out. It can never reach the human population at all. Looking at the range of possibilities within reasonable parameters can give you a sense of what _might_ happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly**, if you change the `TRAVEL_PROBABILITY` variable to be higher, the percent of the world affected by the time a steady state is reached is substantially higher, possibly even reaching 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, compare the difference between this curve -- where the probability is increased to 10% -- and you'll see it is a basic exponential growth pattern. **Critically, it only reaches a steady state when the entire world has been affected; there is no containment in this scenario.**"
